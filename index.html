<h1>Rubik's Cube Hero</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>	Hello! If your reading this then you are probably interested in, well, me!<br>
  I am only 10 years old yet I have a youtube channel<a href=
  "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv09qgRKYvRRzniYMiAir5Q?view_as=subscriber">
  (follow this link)</a>.<br>. I also know how to solve
  the Rubik's Cube.<br> I know how to code.(I'm making this website by coding).<br>
  Also, I have a shirt store <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/davids-store-182">

<h2>How I learned to solve the Rubik's Cube</h2>
<p>	The whole theme of my youtube channel is Rubik's Cubes.<br> so having a Rubik's
  cube channel without knowing how to solve one is pointless.<br> So, one day when
  we were getting ready to go to Calistoga I decided I wanted to learn to
  solve the Rubik's Cube... <strong>so I did!</strong><br>
   I grabbed my phone and started learning!<br>
  It took me about 5 hours but I finally learned it.<br> It was hard...
  <strong>but you should
  never give up.</strong></p>
